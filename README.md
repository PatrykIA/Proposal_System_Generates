ðŸŒŸ Description

Proposal System Generates is an innovative tool designed for modern sales teams that want to quickly and effectively close deals with clients.

Our system integrates with leading platforms to automate the entire process, from creating a proposal to securing client approval.

ðŸš€ Key Features

- Elegant Client Form: Using a beautifully designed form created with Typeform, you collect essential client information such as name, email, company details, and the challenges they face.
- Automated Content Generation: Thanks to integration with advanced artificial intelligence (powered by OpenAI), our tool transforms client data into professionally crafted descriptions of their problems and proposed solutions, perfectly tailored to their business.
- Document Creation and Delivery: The Make platform connects with PandaDoc to instantly generate an elegant document that is automatically sent to the client. No need for manual proposal creationâ€”everything is handled seamlessly.
- Instant Deal Closure: The client receives the document for review, signs it digitally using PandaDoc, and is then redirected to the Stripe payment system to finalize the transaction. The entire process can be completed within minutes of the first contact, reducing the risk of client hesitation.
